## 🛠️ Your Task (Steps to Complete)

1. ✅ Create a `student` object with:

   - `grade`: a number
   - `subjects`: an array of subjects

2. ✅ Convert it into a JSON string using `JSON.stringify()`.

3. ✅ Display the JSON string on the page using `output.textContent`.

4. ✅ Parse the string back into an object using `JSON.parse()`.

5. ✅ Display the data from the parsed object.

## 🔁 Extension Tasks (Once You Finish the Above)

- ✅ Add a new property like `isEnrolled: true`
- ✅ Add a nested object like `address: { city: "New York", zip: "10001" }`
- ✅ Add more subjects to the array

Stringify and parse again to see how the output changes.
